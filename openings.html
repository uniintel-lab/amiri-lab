					  Prospective Ph.D. students should submit their applications through the Computer Science Department’s <a href="https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science/programs/graduate/phd">Ph.D. program webpage</a>, specifying Dr. Amiri as a potential advisor. We will carefully review your materials. If you wish to contact Dr. Amiri directly, please use the subject line “[PRSP PhD] + your current position and institution/organization” to help prioritize your email. While we make every effort to read all messages, we may not be able to respond to every one. A brief email with a clear explanation of your motivation will facilitate communication.
